# Tavily Search Time Context Rule

## Context

- Apply when performing deep research or searching for time-sensitive information
- Ensures searches are contextualized with the actual current date/time, not the AI's training cutoff
- Prevents confusion with outdated information when searching for current events or topics

## Critical Rules

- Always run the system's date command to get the current date and time before using Tavily search
- Include the current date/time in the search query or context to ensure time-relevant results
- Never rely on your training data cutoff date as the reference point for "current" information
- For time-sensitive searches, explicitly mention the current date in your search queries
- When presenting search results, acknowledge the current date as the reference point
- Always apply these rules for news searches or any query about "latest", "current", or "recent" topics

## Examples

<example>
User: "Research the latest advancements in quantum computing"

Action: First get current system date
```bash
date
# Returns: Sun May 12 14:23:37 EDT 2025
```

Tavily search: "latest advancements in quantum computing as of May 2025"

Response: "Based on the current date (May 12, 2025), the latest quantum computing advancements include..."
</example>

User: "What are the current market trends?"

Action: Immediately searching without time context
Tavily search: "current market trends"

Response: "As of my last update in April 2023, the market trends show..."
