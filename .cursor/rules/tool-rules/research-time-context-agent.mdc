# Time-Accurate Research Protocol

## Context

- Apply when user requests deep research or information that may be time-sensitive
- Ensures that research results consider the actual current date/time rather than training data cutoff
- Addresses the issue of outdated time context in research results

## Critical Rules

- Always obtain current system date/time using terminal date command before conducting research
- Inject current date/time into all research tool requests (especially search tools)
- Explicitly mention the current date in result context (e.g., "As of [date], the information shows...")
- Never rely on internal knowledge cutoff date when time context matters
- For web searches or API requests, include date parameters when available
- When reporting time-sensitive information, explicitly state the reference time

## Examples

<example>
User: "Research the latest developments in quantum computing"

Agent: *First runs date command to get current system time*
```
run_terminal_cmd("date")
```
Result: "Wed May 15 14:32:45 PST 2025"

*Then performs web search with time context*
```
web_search("latest quantum computing developments as of May 2025")
```

Agent: "As of May 15, 2025, the latest developments in quantum computing include [research findings]. The most recent breakthrough announced just last month was [specific detail]..."
</example>

<example type="invalid">
User: "What are the current AI regulations?"

Agent: "Based on my knowledge, the current AI regulations as of my last update in 2023 include..."

*This is invalid because the agent relied on its training data date instead of checking the current system time before providing time-sensitive information.*
